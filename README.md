# Object-Detection-Project

This group project aimed to develop an object detection model capable of identifying various road conditions and turns in images taken on roads in Gilgit. The primary goal of the project was to create a machine learning model that can automatically detect and classify road features such as right turns, left turns, straight roads, and unexpected road conditions like landslides, helping improve road safety and navigation in the Gilgit region. The project was based on the implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework, providing students with hands-on experience in data gathering, labeling, model development, and evaluation.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project were clearly defined as follows:
1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of road images from Gilgit, ensuring a minimum of 50 images for model training and evaluation.
2. Data Annotation: Annotate the collected images to label road conditions, including right turn, left turn, straight, and unexpected conditions such as landslides.
3. Classifier Development: Train a classifier to categorize the images into predefined classes: right turn, left turn, straight, and unexpected.
4. Implementation of YOLO Model: Use YOLO, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model, to detect and classify these road conditions in the images.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and adjust parameters or model architecture as necessary to improve accuracy.
6. Documentation: Document the entire process, from data collection and labeling to model training, evaluation, and results.
